# Net_Practice

NetPractice is a networking and system administration project at 42 that teaches students about TCP/IP addressing, subnetting, and routing. The goal is to correctly configure networks, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and understand the fundamental principles of networking.

### What we have to do in order to complete the project:

- Work with a browser-based training interface.

- Complete 10 levels of networking challenges.

- Configure network devices with correct IP addresses and subnet masks.

- Solve connectivity issues and ensure proper communication between hosts.

- Submit one configuration file per level in your Git repository.

### Through this project, we gain hands-on experience in: ##

- Subnetting & IP Addressing: Understanding how networks are structured.

- Default Gateway & Routing: Learning how traffic moves between networks.

- Network Troubleshooting: Diagnosing and fixing connectivity issues.

- System Administration Basics: Managing small-scale network configurations.
